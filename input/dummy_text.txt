I met Geoffrey Hinton at his house on a pretty street in north London just four days before the bombshell 
announcement that he is quitting Google. Hinton is a pioneer of deep learning who helped develop 
some of the most important techniques at the heart of modern artificial intelligence, 
but after a decade at Google, he is stepping down to focus on new concerns he now has about AI.  

Stunned by the capabilities of new large language models, 
Hinton wants to raise public awareness of the serious risks that he now believes may accompany the technology he ushered in.    

At the start of our conversation, I took a seat at the kitchen table, and Hinton started pacing. 
Plagued for years by chronic back pain, Hinton almost never sits down. 
For the next hour I watched him walk from one end of the room to the other, my head swiveling as he spoke. 
And he had plenty to say.

The 75-year-old computer scientist, who was a joint recipient with Yann LeCun and Yoshua Bengio of the 2018 Turing Award 
for his work on deep learning, says he is ready to shift gears. 
“I'm getting too old to do technical work that requires remembering lots of details,” he told me. 
“I’m still okay, but I’m not nearly as good as I was, and that’s annoying.”

Widely regarded as the “godfather of AI,” Hinton shared the Noble prize with John J. Hopfield 
for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks.
